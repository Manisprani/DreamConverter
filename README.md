# DreamConverter

## Libraries & modules used

For its SVG conversion, DreamConverter uses LibreDWG pre-compiled binaries to convert from DWG to a readable format. LibreDWG is also licensed under GNU GPL v3, and the repository and source code can be found at [here](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg).

Libs from GCC is included to easen the installation process. Brief tests showed that computers without a C-compiler suite couldn't run the pre-compiled libredwg binaries.
